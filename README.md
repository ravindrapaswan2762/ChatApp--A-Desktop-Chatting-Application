# ChatApp--A-Desktop-Chatting-Application
  It is a desktop application that helps people to chat with each other. Here I have developed an application in which one person will act as server and other as         client. I have developed code for server-client communication.

# Pre-requisites
  • Any IDE, here i am are using Eclipse.\
  • Window Builder should be installed in Eclipse.\
  • Basics of Swing and AWT.\
  • Server-Socket Basics.
  
# Programming Language
  • Java
  
# IDE used:
  • Eclipse
  
# Objective
   Created a desktop application which will help two people to communicate between each other. Here i have developed a server and a client. This server can send and        receive the message to client. The same manner client can also send message to the server and client can receive the message send by the server. So, it is a two-way    communication between the client and the server using Socket Programming. The overall outlook of the client and server is similar to the WhatsApp interface. 

# Primary Goals
   • Create Server Page\
   • Setup the design of server page\
   • Create Client Page\
   • Setup the design of client page\
   • Establish the connection between Server and client

# Design
   • Made a rough design how the system looks like.\
   • Here I have mainly created two pages.\
       1. Server\
       2. Client
   
# Server Design
   • Made a rough design of Server\

# Steps Involved

     • Installed the necessary software for the project.
     • I collected information for the project.
     • Created a design, what my system should look like.
     • Found the process that I am implementing in the project.
     • Corrected the actions that took place.
     • Now worked on the design part of the project.
     • After the design was completed, worked on the programming part. Build source code.
     • Tested the program and installed errors and fixed it.
     • Once all the errors are fixed, I have done the final implementation (run) of the code.
   
# Conclusion
    This desktop application will help people to communicate with each other. The design of the server and the client page is similar to the WhatsApp user interface.\     Here the message from the server is send to the client and the client can receive message from the server and give the response back to the server also.\
    This is a basic application. This application will help people to communicate with each other in simple manner.
